MSG Automl can support clustering and both supervised and unsupervised learning, consisting of various models for classification, regression and clustering depending on how your input csv looks like. The system will show comparison between different models and also the parameters and the evaluation result for the best model recommended by our system.


Due to time constraint for the Hackathon, there are still a lot of areas to be improved and more machine learning algorithms to be included in the system. However, the idea is there and everyone can try to make it better.
